## My process

### Built with

- Webpack
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- Object Oriented Programming and Javascript classes

### What I learned

This was a game I always wanted to replicate since I played it on my old brick NOKIA phone. I had fun thinking through how I would build it and was even able to implement a mobile control board so it can be played from the phone, just like the old days!
